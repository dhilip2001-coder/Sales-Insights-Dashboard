## Problem Statement

Atliq Hardware, a hardware manufacturing company, has recently observed a consistent decline in its overall sales performance. The CEO is unable to gain a clear picture of what’s happening across regions and product lines, despite receiving numerous Excel reports from regional managers. These reports are often dense, inconsistent, and lack actionable clarity.

To make informed decisions, the leadership needs a centralized, easy-to-understand dashboard that provides clear insights into sales and profit trends. Specifically, the company wants to identify:

*The most profitable regions and product segments

*Areas where profit margins are declining

*Overall sales performance over time


### Problem Description 

This project focuses on designing a Sales Insights Dashboard that helps Atliq Hardware’s leadership team gain quick and actionable insights into business performance using real sales data.
